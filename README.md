# BrowserSkypeTools
Abused an exploit with the browser version of Skype to do certain things. If you sent a messageid that already existed, it would drag that message down on the client version of Skype as if it were just posted. Based around this exploit, you could chaoticlly move around messages or even have a message stickied to the bottom. The exploit was patched eventually. This was mainly a project for me to learn javascript for the first time.
